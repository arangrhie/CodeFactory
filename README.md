Java codes for handling various sequencing data in bioinformatics

This is a collection of codes written in Java, in the purpose of genomic / transcriptomic sequencing data analysis.
Some of the codes were written as coding excercise, and can be replaced by some other simple linux commands.

To read the code, I would recommend to clone the repository on Eclipse.
All external libraries are under ext-lib. Add them if needed in your classpath for building.
